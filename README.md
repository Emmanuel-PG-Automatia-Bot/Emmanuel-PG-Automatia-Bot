## ðŸ‘¤ Emmanuel Palacio Gaviria â€“ Backend Architect | Core Team at Automatia

At Automatia, we are pioneering a new era where artificial intelligence, advanced automation, and virtual reality converge to create transformative experiences in the healthcare sector and beyond. Our mission transcends the development of virtual assistants; we design systems that automate entire workflows, optimize operations, strategically capture leads, and transform visionary ideas into tangible technological solutions.

As a member of Automatia's core team, I have led the technological architecture underpinning our products. Specializing in backend development with Python and serverless architectures on AWS, my work focuses on building resilient, scalable, and secure platforms. I designed Automatia's automated backup system, migrated critical workflows from Botpress to Lambda functionsâ€”significantly reducing operational costsâ€”and standardized quality processes using tools like `pylint`, `bandit`, `detect-secrets`, `conventional commits`, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

My approach combines technical precision with creative vision. I am passionate about crafting code that not only functions but also scales, is maintainable, and delivers real impact.
